# Factors Influencing World Hunger

## Project Overview

This project explores the critical issue of world hunger by examining the factors influencing hunger challenges globally. Hunger, as defined by the United Nations Hunger Report refers to severe food insecurity and undernourishment. Using multiple datasets on hunger, climate, economy, agriculture, and malnutrition, the project identifies patterns, trends, and correlations that shed light on the persistent global challenge of hunger. The goal is to explore the different datasets and see the influence each has on world hunger.

## Data Sources

- Global Hunger Index Dataset: Measures hunger levels in various countries across four years (2000, 2006, 2012, and 2021).
  Published by Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe, processed by Our World in Data.
- Economic Indicators Dataset: Includes GDP, trade balance, per capita GNI, and household consumption expenditure.
Source: Kaggle (Creative Commons Public Domain).

- Climate Dataset: Tracks CO2 emissions, rainfall patterns, and global temperature changes (2000â€“2024).
Source: Kaggle (Community Data License Agreement).

- Agriculture Dataset: Provides data on crop production, fertilizers, and land use (2000, 2006, 2012, 2021).
Source: Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).
- Malnutrition Dataset: Focuses on mortality rates linked to malnutrition globally.

## Tools

- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- SQL 
- Data visualization libraries for exploration and analysis

## Data Cleaning

- Addressed null values and dropped irrelevant columns (e.g., "Year Code").
- Standardized variable names for consistency across datasets.

## Guiding Questions

1. How have hunger levels changed over time in different countries, and which countries show improvements or declines?
2. What regions have been most affected in our climate data and has this possibly impacted global hunger and malnutrition deaths?
3. How have changes in agricultural produce impacted global hunger in regions with the highest global hunger index score?


## Data Analysis and Results

This section outlines key analyses performed to uncover the factors influencing world hunger using five datasets: Global Hunger Index, Economic Indicators, Climate, Agriculture, and Malnutrition.

#### Key Findings:
A global decline in hunger scores was observed, indicating progress in reducing hunger.
Disparities persist: Yemen and Venezuela experienced the most significant increases in hunger scores due to socio-economic and political instability.
Mongolia and China achieved notable progress, reducing hunger by ~80%, linked to improved economic and agricultural policies.
